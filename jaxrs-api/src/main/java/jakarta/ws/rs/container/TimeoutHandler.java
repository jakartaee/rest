/**
 * Asynchronous response suspend time-out handler.
 *
 * JAX-RS users may utilize this callback interface to provide custom resolution of time-out events.
 * <p>
 * By default, JAX-RS runtime generates a {@link jakarta.ws.rs.WebApplicationException} with a
 * {@link jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response.Status#SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE HTTP 503 (Service unavailable)} error response status
 * code. A custom time-out handler may be {@link AsyncResponse#setTimeoutHandler(TimeoutHandler) set} on an asynchronous
 * response instance to provide custom time-out event resolution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In case of a suspend time-out event, a custom time-out handler takes typically one of the following actions:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Resumes the suspended asynchronous response using a {@link AsyncResponse#resume(Object) custom response} or a
 * {@link AsyncResponse#resume(Throwable) custom exception}</li>
 * <li>Cancels the response by calling one of the {@link AsyncResponse} {@code cancel(...)} methods.</li>
 * <li>Extends the suspend period of the response by
 * {@link AsyncResponse#setTimeout(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) setting a new suspend time-out}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the registered time-out handler does not take any of the actions above, the default time-out event processing
 * continues and the response is resumed with a generated {@code WebApplicationException} containing the HTTP 503 status
 * code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Following example illustrates the use of a custom {@code TimeoutHandler}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyTimeoutHandler implements TimeoutHandler {
 *     &hellip;
 *     public void handleTimeout(AsyncResponse ar) {
 *         if (keepSuspended) {
 *             ar.setTimeout(10, SECONDS);
 *         } else if (cancel) {
 *             ar.cancel(retryPeriod);
 *         } else {
 *             ar.resume(defaultResponse);
 *         }
 *     }
 *     &hellip;
 * }
 *
 * &#64;Path("/messages/next")
 * public class MessagingResource {
 *     &hellip;
 *     &#64;GET
 *     public void readMessage(&#64;Suspended AsyncResponse ar) {
 *         ar.setTimeoutHandler(new MyTimeoutHandler());
 *         suspended.put(ar);
 *     }
 *     &hellip;
 * }
 * </pre>
