/**
 * Represents a client or server-side configurable context in JAX-RS.
 *
 * A configurable context can be used to define the JAX-RS components as well as additional meta-data that should be
 * used in the scope of the configured context. The modification of the context typically involves setting properties or
 * registering custom JAX-RS components, such as providers and/or features. All modifications of a {@code Configurable}
 * context are reflected in the associated {@link Configuration} state which is exposed via {@link #getConfiguration()}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * A configurable context can be either indirectly associated with a particular JAX-RS component (such as application or
 * resource method configurable context passed to a {@link Feature} or {@link jakarta.ws.rs.container.DynamicFeature}
 * meta-providers) or can be directly represented by a concrete JAX-RS component implementing the {@code Configurable}
 * interface (such as {@link jakarta.ws.rs.client.Client} or {@link jakarta.ws.rs.client.WebTarget}). As such, the exact
 * scope of a configuration context is typically determined by a use case scenario in which the context is accessed.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Setting properties.</h2>
 * <p>
 * New properties can be set using the {@link #property} method. Similarly, updating a value of an existing property can
 * be achieved using the same method. Information about the configured set of properties is available via the underlying
 * {@code Configuration} object. An existing property can be removed by assigning a {@code null} value to the property.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Registering JAX-RS components.</h2>
 * <p>
 * Registered custom JAX-RS component classes and instances are important part of the contextual configuration
 * information as these are the main factors that determine the capabilities of a configured runtime. Implementations
 * SHOULD warn about and ignore registrations that do not conform to the requirements of supported JAX-RS components in
 * a given configurable context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In most cases, when registering a JAX-RS component, the simplest form of methods ({@link #register(Class)} or
 * {@link #register(Object)}) of the available registration API is sufficient.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * config.register(HtmlDocumentReader.class);
 * config.register(new HtmlDocumentWriter(writerConfig));
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In some situations a JAX-RS component class or instance may implement multiple provider contracts recognized by a
 * JAX-RS implementation (e.g. filter, interceptor or entity provider). By default, the JAX-RS implementation MUST
 * register the new component class or instance as a provider for all the recognized provider contracts implemented by
 * the component class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Priority(ENTITY_CODER)
 * public class GzipInterceptor
 *         implements ReaderInterceptor, WriterInterceptor { ... }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // register GzipInterceptor as a ReaderInterceptor
 * // as well as a WriterInterceptor
 * config.register(GzipInterceptor.class);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * There are however situations when the default registration of a JAX-RS component to all the recognized provider
 * contracts is not desirable. In such cases users may use other versions of the {@code register(...)} method to
 * explicitly specify the collection of the provider contracts for which the JAX-RS component should be registered
 * and/or the priority of each registered provider contract.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Priority(USER)
 * public class ClientLoggingFilter
 *         implements ClientRequestFilter, ClientResponseFilter { ... }
 *
 * &#64;Priority(ENTITY_CODER)
 * public class GzipInterceptor
 *         implements ReaderInterceptor, WriterInterceptor { ... }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // register ClientLoggingFilter as a ClientResponseFilter only
 * config.register(ClientLoggingFilter.class, ClientResponseFilter.class);
 *
 * // override the priority of registered GzipInterceptor
 * // and both of its provider contracts
 * config.register(GzipInterceptor.class, 6500);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * As a general rule, for each JAX-RS component class there can be at most one registration &mdash; class-based or
 * instance-based &mdash; configured at any given moment. Implementations MUST reject any attempts to configure a new
 * registration for a provider class that has been already registered in the given configurable context earlier.
 * Implementations SHOULD also raise a warning to inform the user about the rejected component registration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * config.register(GzipInterceptor.class, WriterInterceptor.class);
 * config.register(GzipInterceptor.class); // Rejected by runtime.
 * config.register(new GzipInterceptor()); // Rejected by runtime.
 * config.register(GzipInterceptor.class, 6500); // Rejected by runtime.
 *
 * config.register(new ClientLoggingFilter());
 * config.register(ClientLoggingFilter.class); // rejected by runtime.
 * config.register(ClientLoggingFilter.class,
 *         ClientResponseFilter.class); // Rejected by runtime.
 * </pre>
