 * Outbound Server-Sent Events stream.
 * <p>
 * The instance of {@link SseEventSink} can be only acquired by injection of a resource method parameter:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;GET
 * &#64;Path("eventStream")
 * &#64;Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
 * public void eventStream(@Context SseEventSink eventSink) {

 *
 * The injected instance is then considered as a return type, so the resource method doesn't return anything, similarly
 * as in server-side async processing.
 * <p>
 * The underlying client connection is kept open and the application code is able to send events. A server-side instance
 * implementing the interface corresponds exactly to a single client HTTP connection.
 * <p>
 * The injected instance is thread safe.
