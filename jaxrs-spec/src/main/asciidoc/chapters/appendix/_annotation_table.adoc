== Summary of Annotations

[cols="4,5,8"]
|===============================================
|*Annotation*   |*Target*           |*Description*
|`Consumes`     |Type or method     |Specifies a list of media types that can be consumed.
|`Produces`     |Type or method     |Specifies a list of media types that can
be produced.
|`GET`          |Method             |Specifies that the annotated method
handles HTTP GET requests.
|`POST`         |Method             |Specifies that the
annotated method handles HTTP POST requests.
|`PUT`          |Method             |Specifies
that the annotated method handles HTTP PUT requests.
|`DELETE`       |Method             |Specifies that the annotated method handles HTTP DELETE requests.
|`PATCH`        |Method             |Specifies that the annotated method handles HTTP
PATCH requests.
|`HEAD`         |Method             |Specifies that the annotated method
handles HTTP HEAD requests. Note that HEAD may be automatically handled,
see <<head_and_options>>.
|`OPTIONS`      |Method             |Specifies that the
annotated method handles HTTP OPTIONS requests.
|`ApplicationPath`  |Type           |Specifies the resource-wide application
path that forms the base URI of all root resource classes.
|`Path`         |Type or method     |Specifies a relative path for a resource.
When used on a class this annotation
identifies that class as a root resource. When used on a method this
annotation identifies a sub-resource method or locator.
|`PathParam` |Parameter, field or method    |Specifies that the value of a method
parameter, class field, or bean property is to be extracted from the
request URI path. The value of the annotation identifies the name of a
URI template parameter.
|`QueryParam`   |Parameter, field or method
|Specifies that the value of a method parameter, class field, or bean
property is to be extracted from a URI query parameter. The value of the
annotation identifies the name of a query parameter.
|`FormParam`    |Parameter, field or method |Specifies that the value of a method
parameter is to be extracted from a form parameter in a request entity
body. The value of the annotation identifies the name of a form
parameter. Note that whilst the annotation target allows use on fields
and methods, the specification only requires support for use on resource
method parameters.
|`MatrixParam`  |Parameter, field or method     |Specifies
that the value of a method parameter, class field, or bean property is
to be extracted from a URI matrix parameter. The value of the annotation
identifies the name of a matrix parameter.
|`CookieParam`  |Parameter, field or method |Specifies that the value of
a method parameter, class
field, or bean property is to be extracted from a HTTP cookie. The value
of the annotation identifies the name of a the cookie.
|`HeaderParam` |Parameter, field or method  |Specifies that the value of a method
parameter, class field, or bean property is to be extracted from a HTTP
header. The value of the annotation identifies the name of a HTTP
header.
|`Encoded`      |Type, constructor, method, field or parameter
|Disables automatic URI decoding for path, query, form and matrix
parameters.
|`DefaultValue` |Parameter, field or method     |Specifies a
default value for a field, property or method parameter annotated with
`@QueryParam`, `@MatrixParam`, `@CookieParam`, `@FormParam` or
`@HeaderParam`. The specified value will be used if the corresponding
query or matrix parameter is not present in the request URI, if the
corresponding form parameter is not in the request entity body, or if
the corresponding HTTP header is not included in the request.
|`Context`  |Field, method or parameter |Identifies an injection target for one of
the types listed in <<contexttypes>> or the applicable section of
Chapter <<environment>>.
|`HttpMethod`   |Annotation     |Specifies the HTTP
method for a request method designator annotation.
|`Provider`     |Type   |Specifies that the annotated class implements a JAX-RS extension
interface.
3+|*Since JAX-RS 2.0*
|`NameBinding`  |Annotation |Meta-annotation to create annotations for
binding filters or interceptors to resource methods and applications.
Name binding is only supported as part of the Server API.
|`PreMatching`  |Type   |Global binding annotation that can be applied to
a container filter to indicate that it should be applied globally and
before the resource method is matched.
|`BeanParam`    |Parameter, field or method         |Can be used to inject
a user-defined bean whose fields and
properties may be annotated with JAX-RS param
annotations.
|`ConstrainedTo`    |Type   |Can be used to restrict the
applicability of a provider to just the Client API or just the Server
API. If omitted, a provider can be used in either context.
|`ParamConverter.Lazy`  |Type   |Indicates that a conversion of a default
value delegated to a `ParamConverter` SHOULD occur only when the value
is actually requested.
3+|*Since JAX-RS 3.1*
|`Body`  |Annotation |Indicates the entity parameter mapped from the
request entity body.
