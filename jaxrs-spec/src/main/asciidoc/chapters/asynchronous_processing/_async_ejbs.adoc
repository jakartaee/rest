=== EJB Resource Classes

As stated in <<ejbs>>, JAX-RS implementations in products that
support EJB must also support the use of stateless and singleton session
beans as root resource classes. When an EJB method is annotated with
`@Asynchronous`, the EJB container automatically allocates the necessary
resources for its execution. Thus, in this scenario, the use of an
`Executor` is unnecessary to generate an asynchronous response.

Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Stateless
@Path("/")
class EJBResource {

    @GET @Asynchronous
    public void longRunningOp(AsyncResponse ar) {
        executeLongRunningOp();
        ar.resume("Hello async world!");
    }
}
----

There is no explicit thread management needed in this case since that is
under the control of the EJB container. Just like the other examples in
this chapter, the response is produced by calling `resume` on the
injected `AsyncResponse`. Hence, the return type of `longRunningOp` is
simply `void`.
