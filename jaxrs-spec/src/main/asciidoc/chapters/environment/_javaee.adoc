[[javaee]]
=== Integration with Jakarta EE Technologies

This section describes the additional requirements that apply to a
JAX-RS implementation when combined in a product that supports the
following specifications.

[[servlets]]
==== Servlets

In a product that also supports the Servlet specification,
implementations MUST support JAX-RS applications that are packaged as a
Web application. See <<servlet>> for more information Web
application packaging.

It is RECOMMENDED for a JAX-RS implementation to provide asynchronous
processing support, as defined in <<asynchronous_processing>>, by
enabling asynchronous processing (i.e., `asyncSupported=true`) in the
underlying Servlet 3 container. It is OPTIONAL for a
JAX-RS implementation to support asynchronous processing when running on
a Servlet container whose version is prior to 3.

As explained in <<servlet_container>>, injection of
Servlet-defined types is possible using the `@Inject` annotation.
Additionally, web application’s `<context-param>` and servlet’s
`<init-param>` can be used to define application properties passed to
server-side features or injected into server-side JAX-RS components. See
Javadoc for `Application.getProperties` for more information.

[[managed_beans]]
==== Managed Beans

In a product that supports Managed Beans, implementations MUST support
the use of Managed Beans as root resource classes, providers and
`Application` subclasses.

For example, a bean that uses a managed-bean interceptor can be defined
as a JAX-RS resource as follows:

[source,java]
----
@ManagedBean
@Path("/managedbean")
public class ManagedBeanResource {

    public static class MyInterceptor {
        @AroundInvoke
        public String around(InvocationContext ctx) throws Exception {
            System.out.println("around() called");
            return (String) ctx.proceed();
        }
    }

    @GET
    @Produces("text/plain")
    @Interceptors(MyInterceptor.class)
    public String getIt() {
        return "Hi managedbean!";
    }
}
----

The example above uses a managed-bean interceptor to intercept calls to
the resource method `getIt`. See <<additional_reqs>> for
additional requirements on Managed Beans.

[[cdi]]
==== Context and Dependency Injection (CDI)

In a product that supports CDI, implementations MUST support the use of
CDI-style Beans as root resource classes, providers and `Application`
subclasses. Providers and `Application` subclasses MUST be singletons or
use application scope.

For example, assuming CDI is enabled via the inclusion of a `beans.xml`
file, a CDI-style bean that can be defined as a JAX-RS resource as
follows:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/cdibean")
public class CdiBeanResource {

    @Inject MyOtherCdiBean bean;    // CDI injected bean

    @GET
    @Produces("text/plain")
    public String getIt() {
        return bean.getIt();
    }
}
----

The example above takes advantage of the type-safe dependency injection
provided in CDI by using another bean, of type `MyOtherCdiBean`, in
order to return a resource representation. See <<additional_reqs>>
for additional requirements on CDI-style Beans.

[[ejbs]]
==== Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs)

In a product that supports EJBs, an implementation MUST support the use
of stateless and singleton session beans as root resource classes,
providers and `Application` subclasses. JAX-RS annotations can be
applied to methods in an EJB’s local interface or directly to methods in
a no-interface EJB. Resource class annotations (like `@Path`) MUST be
applied to an EJB’s class directly following the annotation inheritance
rules defined in <<annotationinheritance>>.

For example, a stateless EJB that implements a local interface can be
defined as a JAX-RS resource class as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Local
public interface LocalEjb {

    @GET
    @Produces("text/plain")
    public String getIt();
}

@Stateless
@Path("/stateless")
public class StatelessEjbResource implements LocalEjb {

    @Override
    public String getIt() {
        return "Hi stateless!";
    }
}
----

JAX-RS implementations are REQUIRED to discover EJBs by inspecting
annotations on classes and local interfaces; they are not REQUIRED to
read EJB deployment descriptors (ejb-jar.xml). Therefore, any
information in an EJB deployment descriptor for the purpose of
overriding EJB annotations or providing additional meta-data will likely
result in a non-portable JAX-RS application.

If an `ExceptionMapper` for a `EJBException` or subclass is not included
with an application then exceptions thrown by an EJB resource class or
provider method MUST be unwrapped and processed as described in <<method_exc>>.

See <<async_ejbs>> for more information on asynchronous EJB
methods and <<additional_reqs>> for additional requirements on
EJBs.

[[bv_support]]
==== Bean Validation

In a product that supports the Bean Validation specification <<bib16>>
, implementations MUST support resource validation using constraint
annotations as described in Chapter <<validation>>. Otherwise, support for
resource validation is OPTIONAL.

[[jsonp]]
==== Java API for JSON Processing

In a product that supports the Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P)
<<bib18>>, implementations MUST support entity providers for
`JsonValue` and all of its sub-types: `JsonStructure`, `JsonObject`,
`JsonArray`, `JsonString` and `JsonNumber`.

Note that other types from the JSON-P API such as `JsonParser`,
`JsonGenerator`, `JsonReader` and `JsonWriter` can also be integrated
into JAX-RS applications using the entity providers for `InputStream`
and `StreamingOutput`.

[[jsonb]]
==== Java API for JSON Binding

In a product that supports the Java API for JSON Binding (JSON-B)
<<bib19>>, implementations MUST support entity providers for all
Java types supported by JSON-B in combination with the following media
types: `application/json`, `text/json` as well as any other media types
matching `/json` or `/*+json`.

Note that if JSON-B and JSON-P are both supported in the same
environment, entity providers for JSON-B take precedence over those for
JSON-P for all types except `JsonValue` and its sub-types.

[[jaxb]]
==== Jakarta XML Binding

In a product that supports the Jakarta XML Binding API (JAXB)
<<bib21>>, implementations MUST support entity providers for the type,
`jakarta.xml.bind.JAXBElement`, and application-supplied JAXB classes
in combination with the following XML-based media types:
`text/xml` and `application/xml` and media types of the
form `application/*+xml`.

[[additional_reqs]]
==== Additional Requirements

The following additional requirements apply when using Managed Beans,
CDI-style Beans or EJBs as resource classes, providers or `Application`
subclasses:

* For JAX-RS resources and providers where the JAX-RS implementation 
participates in their creation and initialization, field and property
injection in these resources and providers MUST be performed prior to the
container invoking any `@PostConstruct` annotated method. For resources
and providers created by the application (e.g. instances returned via the
`Application.getSingletons()` method, or instances passed via
`Configurable.register`), this requirement does not apply.
* Support for constructor injection of JAX-RS resources is OPTIONAL.
Portable applications MUST instead use fields or bean properties in
conjunction with a `@PostConstruct` annotated method. Implementations
SHOULD warn users about use of non-portable constructor injection.
* Implementations MUST NOT require use of `@Inject` or `@Resource` to
trigger injection of JAX-RS annotated fields or properties.
Implementations MAY support such usage but SHOULD warn users about
non-portability.
