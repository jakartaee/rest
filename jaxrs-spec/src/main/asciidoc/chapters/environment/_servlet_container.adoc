[[servlet_container]]
=== Servlet Container

The `@Inject`Â annotation can be used to indicate a dependency on a
Servlet-defined resource. A Servlet-based implementation MUST support
injection of the following Servlet-defined types: `ServletConfig`,
`ServletContext`, `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse`.

An injected `HttpServletRequest` allows a resource method to stream the
contents of a request entity. If the resource method has a parameter
whose value is derived from the request entity then the stream will have
already been consumed and an attempt to access it MAY result in an
exception.

An injected `HttpServletResponse` allows a resource method to commit the
HTTP response prior to returning. An implementation MUST check the
committed status and only process the return value if the response is
not yet committed.

Servlet filters may trigger consumption of a request body by accessing
request parameters. In a servlet container the @FormParam annotation and
the standard entity provider for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
MUST obtain their values from the servlet request parameters if the
request body has already been consumed. Servlet APIs do not
differentiate between parameters in the URI and body of a request so
URI-based query parameters may be included in the entity parameter.
