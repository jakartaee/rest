[[priorities]]
=== Priorities

The order in which filters and interceptors are executed as part of
their corresponding chains is controlled by the `@Priority` annotation
defined in <<bib15>>. Priorities are represented by integer
numbers. Execution chains for extension points `ContainerRequest`,
`PreMatchContainerRequest`, `ClientRequest`, `ReadFrom` and `WriteTo`
are sorted in __ascending order__;
the lower the number the higher the priority.
Execution chains for extension points `ContainerResponse` and
`ClientResponse` are sorted in __descending order__;
the higher the number the higher the priority. These rules
ensure that response filters are executed in reversed order of request
filters.

The `Priorities` class in JAX-RS defines a set of built-in priorities
for security, header decorators, decoders and encoders. The default
binding priority is `jakarta.ws.rs.Priorities.USER`. For example, the
priority of an authentication filter can be set as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Provider
@Authenticated
@Priority(Priorities.AUTHENTICATION)
public class AuthenticationFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {
    ...
}
----

Note that even though, as explained in <<binding_in_client_api>>,
annotations are not used for binding in the Client API, they are still
used to define priorities. Therefore, if a priority other than the
default is required, the `@Priority` annotation must be used for a
filter or interceptor registered with the Client API.

The order in which filters and interceptors that belong to the same
priority class are executed is implementation dependent.
