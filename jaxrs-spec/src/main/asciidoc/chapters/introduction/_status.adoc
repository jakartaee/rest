[[context-injection]]
==== Support for @Context Injection

As part of an effort to better align with https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/[Jakarta CDI],
future versions of this API will no longer support `@Context` injection and related types such as
`ContextResolver`. As much as possible, all injection tasks will be delegated to
Jakarta CDI for a better integration into the https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE] ecosystem.
