[[exceptions_providers]]
=== Exceptions

Exception handling differs depending on whether a provider is part of
the client runtime or server runtime. This is covered in the next two
sections.

[[exceptions_providers_server]]
==== Server Runtime

When a provider method throws an exception, the JAX-RS server runtime
will attempt to map the exception to a suitable HTTP response in the
same way as described for methods and locators in <<method_exc>>.
If the exception is thrown while generating a response,
JAX-RS implementations are required to map the exception _only when_ the
response has not been committed yet.

As explained in <<exceptionmapper>>, an application can supply
exception mapping providers to customize this mapping, but these
exception mappers will be ignored during the processing of a _previously
mapped_ response to avoid entering a potentially infinite loop. For
example, suppose a method in a message body reader throws an exception
that is mapped to a response via an exception mapping provider; if the
message body writer throws an exception while trying to write the mapped
response, JAX-RS implementations will not attempt to map the exception
again.

[[exceptions_providers_client]]
==== Client Runtime

When a provider method throws an exception, the JAX-RS client runtime
will map it to an instance of `ProcessingException` if thrown while
processing a request, and to a `ResponseProcessingException` if thrown
while processing a response.

Note that the client runtime will only throw an instance of
`WebApplicationException` (or any of its subclasses) as a result of a
response from the server with status codes 3xx, 4xx or 5xx.
See <<client_exceptions>> for more details on `WebApplicationException`.
