[[resource-classes]]
=== Resource Classes

A resource class is a Java class that uses JAX-RS annotations to
implement a corresponding Web resource. Resource classes are POJOs that
have at least one method annotated with `@Path` or a request method
designator.

[[lifecycle-and-environment]]
==== Lifecycle and Environment

By default a new resource class instance is created for each request to
that resource. First the constructor (see <<resource_class_constructor>>)
is called, then any requested dependencies
are injected (see <<resource_field>>), then the appropriate method
(see <<resource_method>>) is invoked and finally the object is
made available for garbage collection.

An implementation MAY offer other resource class lifecycles, mechanisms
for specifying these are outside the scope of this specification.
E.g. an implementation based on an inversion-of-control framework may
support all of the lifecycle options provided by that framework.

[[resource_class_constructor]]
==== Constructors

Root resource classes are instantiated by the JAX-RS runtime and MUST
have a public constructor for which the JAX-RS runtime can provide all
parameter values. Note that a zero argument constructor is permissible
under this rule.

A public constructor MAY include parameters annotated with one of the
following: `@HeaderParam`, `@CookieParam`, `@MatrixParam`, `@QueryParam` or
`@PathParam`. However, depending on the resource class lifecycle and
concurrency, per-request information may not make sense in a
constructor. If more than one public constructor is suitable then an
implementation MUST use the one with the most parameters. Choosing
amongst suitable constructors with the same number of parameters is
implementation specific, implementations SHOULD generate a warning about
such ambiguity.

Non-root resource classes are instantiated by an application and do not
require the above-described public constructor.
