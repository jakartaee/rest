[[resource_field]]
=== Fields and Bean Properties

When a resource class is instantiated, the values of fields and bean
properties annotated with one the following annotations are set
according to the semantics of the annotation:

`@MatrixParam`::
  Extracts the value of a URI matrix parameter.
`@QueryParam`::
  Extracts the value of a URI query parameter.
`@PathParam`::
  Extracts the value of a URI template parameter.
`@CookieParam`::
  Extracts the value of a cookie.
`@HeaderParam`::
  Extracts the value of a header.
`@Inject`::
  Injects an instance of a supported resource.

Because injection occurs at object creation time, use of these
annotations (with the exception of `@Inject`) on resource class fields
and bean properties is only supported for the default per-request
resource class lifecycle. An implementation SHOULD warn if resource
classes with other lifecycles use these annotations on resource class
fields or bean properties.

A JAX-RS implementation is only required to set the annotated field and
bean property values of instances created by its runtime. Objects
returned by sub-resource locators (see <<sub_resources>>) are
expected to be initialized by their creator.

Valid parameter types for each of the above annotations are listed in
the corresponding Javadoc, however in general (excluding `@Inject`) the
following types are supported:

1.  Types for which a `ParamConverter` is available via
a registered `ParamConverterProvider`. See Javadoc for these classes for
more information.
2.  Primitive types.
3.  Types that have a constructor that accepts a single
`String` argument.
4.  Types that have a static method named `valueOf` or
`fromString` with a single `String` argument that return an instance of
the type. If both methods are present then `valueOf` MUST be used unless
the type is an enum in which case `fromString` MUST be usedfootnote:[Due
to limitations of the built-in `valueOf` method that is part of all Java
enumerations, a `fromString` method is often defined by the enum
writers. Consequently, the `fromString` method is preferred when
available.].
5.  `List<T>`, `Set<T>`, `SortedSet<T>` or an array `T[]`, where
`T` satisfies 1, 3 or 4 above.

The `DefaultValue` annotation may be used to supply a default value for
some of the above, see the Javadoc for `DefaultValue` for usage details
and rules for generating a value in the absence of this annotation and
the requested data. The `Encoded` annotation may be used to disable
automatic URI decoding for `@MatrixParam`, `@QueryParam`, and
`@PathParam` annotated fields and properties.

A `WebApplicationException` thrown during construction of field or
property values using any of the 5 steps listed above is processed
directly as described in <<method_exc>>. Other exceptions thrown
during construction of field or property values using any of the 5 steps
listed above are treated as client errors: if the field or property is
annotated with `@MatrixParam`, `@QueryParam` or `@PathParam` then an
implementation MUST generate an instance of `NotFoundException` (404
status) that wraps the thrown exception and no entity; if the field or
property is annotated with `@HeaderParam` or `@CookieParam` then an
implementation MUST generate an instance of `BadRequestException` (400
status) that wraps the thrown exception and no entity. Exceptions MUST
be processed as described in <<method_exc>>.
