[[sse_broadcasting]]
=== Broadcasting

Applications may need to send events to multiple clients simultaneously.
This action is called _broadcasting_ in JAX-RS. Multiple
`SseEventSink`’s can be registered on a single `SseBroadcaster`.

A broadcaster can only be created by calling method `newBroadcaster` on
the injected `Sse` instance. The life-cycle and scope of an
`SseBroadcaster` is fully controlled by applications and not the
JAX-RS runtime. The following example shows the use of broadcasters,
note the `@Singleton` annotation on the resource class:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/")
@Singleton
public class SseResource {

    @Inject
    private Sse sse;

    private volatile SseBroadcaster sseBroadcaster;

    @PostConstruct
    public init() {
        this.sseBroadcaster = sse.newBroadcaster();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("register")
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
    public void register(SseEventSink eventSink) {
        eventSink.send(sse.newEvent("welcome!"));
        sseBroadcaster.register(eventSink);
    }

    @POST
    @Path("broadcast")
    @Consumes(MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA)
    public void broadcast(@FormParam("event") String event) {
        sseBroadcaster.broadcast(sse.newEvent(event));
    }
}
----

The `register` method on a broadcaster is used to add a new
`SseEventSink`; the `broadcast` method is used to send an SSE event to
all registered consumers.
