=== Environment

The `SseEventSource` class uses the existing JAX-RS mechanism based on
`RuntimeDelegate` to find an implementation using the service name
`jakarta.ws.rs.sse.SseEventSource.Builder`. The majority of types in the
`jakarta.ws.rs.sse` are thread safe; the reader is referred to the Javadoc
for more information on thread safety.
