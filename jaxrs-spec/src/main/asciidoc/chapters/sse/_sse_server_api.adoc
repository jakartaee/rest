[[sse_server_api]]
=== Server API

The JAX-RSÂ SSE server API is used to accept connections and send events
to one or more clients. A resource method that injects an `SseEventSink`
and produces the media type `text/event-stream` is an SSE resource
method.

The following example accepts SSE connections and uses an executor
thread to send 3 events before closing the connection:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("eventStream")
@Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
public void eventStream(SseEventSink eventSink,
                        Sse sse) {
    executor.execute(() -> {
        try (SseEventSink sink = eventSink) {
            eventSink.send(sse.newEvent("event1"));
            eventSink.send(sse.newEvent("event2"));
            eventSink.send(sse.newEvent("event3"));
        }
    });
}
----

SSE resource methods follow a similar pattern to those for asynchronous
processing (see <<introduction_async>>) in that the object
representing the incoming connection, in this case `SseEventSink`, is
injected into the resource method.

The example above also injects the `Sse` type which provides factory
methods for events and broadcasters. See <<sse_broadcasting>> for
more information about broadcasting. Note that, just like
`SseEventSource`, the interface `SseEventSink` is also auto-closeable,
hence the use of the _try-with-resources_ statement above.

Method `send` on `SseEventSink` returns a `CompletionStage<?>` as a way
to provide a _handle_ to the action of asynchronously sending a message
to a client.
