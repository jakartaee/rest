[[validation_and_error_reporting]]
=== Validation and Error Reporting

Constraint annotations are allowed in the same locations as the
following annotations: `@MatrixParam`, `@QueryParam`, `@PathParam`,
`@CookieParam`, and `@HeaderParam`, _except_ in class constructors and
property setters. Specifically, they are allowed in resource method
parameters, fields and property getters as well as resource classes,
entity parameters and resource methods (return values).

The default resource class instance lifecycle is per-request in JAX-RS.
Implementations MAY support other lifecycles; the same caveats related
to the use of other JAX-RS annotations in resource classes apply to
constraint annotations. For example, a constraint validation annotating
a constructor parameter in a resource class whose lifecycle is singleton
will only be executed once.

JAX-RS implementations SHOULD use the following process to validate
resource class instances after they have been instantiated:

Phase 1::
  Inject field values and initialize bean properties as described in
  Section <<resource_field>>.
Phase 2::
  Validate annotations on fields, property getters (if enabled) and the
  resource class. The order in which these validations are executed is
  implementation dependent.
Phase 3::
  Validate annotations on parameters passed to the resource method
  matched.
Phase 4::
  If no constraint violations found thus far, invoke resource method and
  validate returned value.

The exception model in <<bib16>> defines a base class
`jakarta.validation.ValidationException` and a few subclasses to report
errors that are specific to constraint definitions, constraint
declarations, group definitions and constraint violations.
JAX-RS implementations MUST provide a default exception mapper (see
<<exceptionmapper>>) for `jakarta.validation.ValidationException`
according to the following rules:

1.  If the exception is of type `jakarta.validation.ValidationException`
or any of its subclasses _excluding_
`jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolationException`, then it is mapped to a
response with status code 500 (Internal Server Error).
2.  If the exception is an instance of
`jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolationException`, then:
a.  If the exception was thrown while validating a method return type,
then it is mapped to a response with status code 500 (Internal Server
Error).footnote:[The property path of a ConstraintViolation provides
information about the location from which an exception originated. See
Javadoc for more information.]
b.  Otherwise, it is mapped to a response with status code 400 (Bad
Request).

In all cases, JAX-RS implementations SHOULD include a response entity
describing the source of the error; however, the exact content and
format of this entity is beyond the scope of this specification. As
described in <<exceptionmapper>>, applications can provide their
own exception mappers and, consequently, customize the default mapper
described above.
