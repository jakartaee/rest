[[GBFYQ]][[a.1-where-do-i-start-to-debug-a-test-failure]]

A.1 Where do I start to debug a test failure?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See link:debug.html#GBFUV[Chapter 6, "Debugging Test Problems,"] for more
information.

[[GBFYR]][[a.2-how-do-i-restart-a-crashed-test-run]]

A.2 How do I restart a crashed test run?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to restart a test run, you can figure out which test crashed
the test suite by looking at the logs.

[[GBFWU]][[a.3-what-would-cause-tests-be-added-to-the-exclude-list]]

A.3 What would cause tests be added to the exclude list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exclude file (+{excludeListFileName}+) contains all tests that are not
required to be run. The file is used only for documentation purpose. The tests are excluded using
@Disabled tag in Junit when necessary. The following is a list of reasons for a test to be
included in the Exclude List:

* An error in a Compatible Implementation that does not allow the test to
execute properly has been discovered.
* An error in the specification that was used as the basis of the test
has been discovered.
* An error in the test has been discovered.
