Preface
-------

This guide describes how to install, configure, and run the Technology
Compatibility Kit (TCK) that is used to test the {TechnologyFullName}
({TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion}) technology.

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK is a portable, configurable automated
test suite for verifying the compatibility of a vendor's
implementation of the {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion}
Specification (hereafter referred to as the vendor implementation or VI).
The {TechnologyShortName} TCK uses the Junit framework to run the test suite
along with Arquillian to run container tests.
