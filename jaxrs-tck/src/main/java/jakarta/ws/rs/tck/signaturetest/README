The latest signature files (specific for Java SE 8 & Java SE 11)  were updated in
the jakartaee-tck repoitory (src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetests/signature-repository) 
for JakartaEE 9 release. The wikipage to generate the signature files is updated in the 
wiki link :
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/wiki/Signature-Tests-in-JakartaEE-TCK



Overview:
1.  Summary of signature contents
2.  Define Signature Test Map File
3.  Record Signatures
4.  Extend the Appropriate Framework Class
5.  Additional Notes



This directory contains a signature test framework that can be extended by
TCK developers to produce signature tests.  This directory also contains
a record-build.xml file.  This file allows developers to record API
signatures.

Developing TCK Signature Tests Using The Framework
--------------------------------------------------
Developing signature tests is a 3 step process.  First, users define a
signature test map file to denote the versions of the packages under test.
Second, users record the signatures of the packages under test.  Third,
users extend one of the signature test classes and implement the getPackages
method.  See below for more detail on each step.


---------------------------------
2. Define Signature Test Map File
---------------------------------
Developers begin by defining a sig-test.map file.  This file denotes which
version of a package should be used when executing a signature test.  This
file does not have to include sub-packages unless the sub-package varies
independently from its parent package.  For instance, say a developer has
to test the jakarta.ejb and jakarta.jms package signatures.  Their map file
would contain the following text:

###############################################################
# The signature test mapping file for the Jakarta EE TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
###############################################################
jakarta.ejb=4.0
jakarta.jms=3.0

This file should be created in $TS_HOME/bin with the name "sig-test.map".
The file should then be copied to $TS_HOME/install/<deliverable>/bin and
source controlled in that directory.  The sig-test.map file should be
copied to $TS_HOME/bin during the install process for a deliverable.

Additionally, different sig-test.map is created specific to the JDK version.
sig-test_se8.map for Java SE 8, sig-test_se11.map for Java SE 11.
If the JDK specific map file does not exist by default sig-test.map will be used 
to run the signature tests.

--------------------
3. Record Signatures
--------------------
Next the user should record the signatures necessary to execute their
signature tests.  All signatures files live in the following directory:
$TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/signature-repository/
Users should see if their signatures already exist in this directory.
Note, every property in the sig-test.map file maps to a signature
file.  For example the property "jakarta.ejb=4.0_se11" maps to the signature
file:
 $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/signature-repository/jakarta.ejb.sig_4.0_se11

If the signature file already exist, the user should checkout the signature
file (using git clone) then record the new signatures and do an "git diff"
on each signature file to see if the signature files match.  If the only changes
to the signature file are in the header then the new signature file can be discarded.  
If the signature files differ elsewhere the user should
unedit the original signature file and change the version ID in their
sig-test.map file and rerecord.  This will create a new signature file with
the appropriate API and leave the original signature file unaltered.  The
new signature file must be placed under source control.

As part of the recording process a "sig-test-pkg-list.txt" file will be generated
in the $TS_HOME/bin directory.  This file should be copied to 
$TS_HOME/install/<deliverable>/bin and source controlled in that directory.  The
sig-test-pkg-list.txt file should be copied to $TS_HOME/bin during the install
process for a deliverable.

See the section below labeled "Example of batch mode using a map file" for
recording instructions.


Recording API Signatures
------------------------

  Batch mode using a signature map file
  -------------------------------------
  - cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/signature-respository

        ant -find record-build.xml \
              -Dsig.source=<location.of.APIs> \
              -Dmap.file=<map.file.path>
              -Drecorder.type=sigtest  \
              record.sig.batch

    Where:
      <location.of.apis>     One or many jar files containing
                             the target package API, separate
                             jar files with ":" on Windows
                             and ";" on other platforms
                             This should also include ALL reference classes (eg rt.jar)
      <map.file.path>        The name and path to the map file
                             that specifies which packages to record
      <recorder.type>        This should be sigtest EXCEPT for JBI which still uses 
                             apicheck as of cts 5.0


Example of batch mode using a map file
--------------------------------------
The following command records the packages listed in the specified map
file including sub-packages.

cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/signature-respository

ant -find record-build.xml \
      -Dsig.source=/appserver/lib/jakartaee-api.jar:${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar  \
      -Dmap.file=$TS_HOME/bin/sig-test.map  \
      -Drecorder.type=sigtest  \
      record.sig.batch

The jakartaee-api.jar should be substituted by the API jar under test.

The contents of the sig-test.map file is (standard java property file):
	jakarta.jms=3.0
	jakarta.mail=2.0
	jakarta.servlet=5.0
	jakarta.ejb=4.0

The output of the above ant command is a set of files containing the
signatures of the specified packages in the sig-test.map file.  The
contents of the $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/signature-repository/
directory is the following after the ant command is run (assuming it was empty):
	jakarta.jms.sig_3.0
	jakarta.mail.sig_2.0
	jakarta.servlet.sig_5.0
	jakarta.ejb.sig_4.0

The jakarta.jms.sig_3.0 file contains the signatures for the jakarta.jms package
including all sub-packages.  The jakarta.mail.sig_3.0 file contains all the
signatures for the jakarta.mail package including all sub-packages so forth
and so on.

The following command records all the Jakarta EE signatures necessary for the
Jakarta EE TCK:

ant -find record-build.xml \
-Dsig.source=$JAVAEE_HOME/lib/jakartaee-api.jar:\
-Dmap.file=$TS_HOME/bin/sig-test.map record.sig.batch



-----------------------------------------
4. Extend the Appropriate Framework Class
-----------------------------------------
Next users should create a sub directory under the directory:
$TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/
This directory will contain their signature test class and a build.xml file.

The user's signature test class must extend either SigTestEE or SigTest
located in $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest.  Users running their
tests in Jakarta EE containers must extend SigTestEE and users not running their
tests in Jakarta EE containers must extend SigTest.  Both the SigTestEE and SigTest
class contain a single abstract method called getPackages.  Users must
implement this method.  The method should return a string array containing 
names of the packages that the signature test should verify.  

There is also an abstract method called getClasses that must be implemented. 
The getClasses method can be used inplace of the getPackages method if there
is a need to specifically list out every class instead of listing packages.
While both of these need to be implemented with at least a stub, it should
only be necessary to list your classes/packages under test within one of
the packages.  As it is now, I believe we only have one area (Common Annotations)
that makes use of the getClasses() method but explicitly listing classes to
test.  The rest of the signature tests use the getPackages() method to identify
what to test - the getPackages() appears to be the more common method to use.

Examples of test classes and a build file are provided in the
$TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest directory.  The 
$TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/javaee directory can also be used
as an example (it contains the Jakarta EE TCK signature tests).  The files:
  $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/build.xml.txt
  $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/SampleSigTest.java.txt
  $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/SampleSigTestEE.java.txt
can be used as templates.

What Goes In My Deliverable
---------------------------
The $TS_HOME/lib/sigtest.jar and $TS_HOME/lib/tsharness.jar must be available
to the signature tests as well as the signature files, the signature map file
and the package list file (the file named "sig-test-pkg-list.txt").
User must also include the test framework classes located in the
$TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest directory.

In provious versions, it was necessary to include the apiCheck.jar file but 
now we should only need to include the sigtest.jar file.  The apiCheck tool
is an older tool used for (pre 5.0) and is not needed EXCEPT for the case of JBI
which still appears to use apiCheck since they are still requiring j2se 1.4 
and not 5.0.  For all other technology areas, include sigtest.jar and not 
apicheck.jar.


What Does NOT Go in My Deliverable
----------------------------------
User must not package the $TS_HOME/lib/recordApiCheck.jar nor the
$TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/record-build.xml files.
Also, do not include sigtestdev.jar.  (sigtestdev.jar includes the
same files as sigtest.jar as well as additional classes used for
recording sigs.  As a general rule, we don't want folks to be able 
to re-record sigs.


Examples
--------
This is a quick example of creating a signature test with an empty
signature repository.

cd $TS_HOME/bin
create the map file named "sig-test.map"
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/signature-repository/

invoke:
        ant -find record-build.xml \
              -Dsig.source=/appserver/lib/jakartaee-api.jar:${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar  \
              -Dmap.file=/jakartaee-tck/install/jakartaee/bin/sig-test.map  \
              -Drecorder.type=sigtest  \
              record.sig.batch

       where:
         sig.source    = <jar_file_under_test>:<any_other_referenced_classes>
                         sig.source will likely match what is being set for the
                         $TS_HOME/bin/ts.jte files sigTestClasspath variable.
         map.file      = file containing technology versions
         recorder.type = signature tests (we can still support api_tests as may be case
                                          with JBI.  ApiCheck is older way of doing things
                                          and is being phased out as of cts 5.0)

git create any signature files that you created.
cd $TS_HOME/bin
cp sig-test.map sig-test-pkg-list.txt $TS_HOME/install/<your_deliverable>/bin/
cd $TS_HOME/install/<your_deliverable>/bin/
sccs create sig-test.map sig-test-pkg-list.txt
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest
mkdir <your_deliverable>
cd <your_deliverable>
cp ../build.xml.txt ./build.xml
"cp ../SampleSigTest.java.txt ./<your_deliverable>SigTest.java" for stand alone sig tests
OR
"cp ../SampleSigTestEE.java.txt ./<your_deliverable>SigTest.java"  for container run sig tests 
Edit <your_deliverable>SigTest.java.java
 - go to the bottom of the file and choose the appropriate test comment, you have
     a choice of two, see the comments in the file to help you decide which
     test comment to use.
 - implement the getPackages method in <your_deliverable>SigTest.java
 - replace the string "<your_test_dir_name>" with the name of your test directory
 - replace the string "<your_test_class_name>" with the name of your test class.
Edit build.xml:
 - replace the string "<your_test_dir_name>" with the name of your test directory
   that you created in step 3 above.
 - replace the string "<your_test_class_name>" with the name of your test class.
 - If your signature tests do not run in any Jakarta EE vehicles edit the package target
   so the target is empty.  In other wordsdDelete the current package target and
   replace it with:
      <target name="package">
      </target>
git create your test class, "<your_deliverable>SigTest.java", and the build.xml file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a quick example of creating a signature test for the Jakarta EE TCK with a
non-empty signature repository.

cd $TS_HOME/bin
create the map file named "sig-test.map"
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/signature-repository/
invoke  ant -find record-build.xml \
              -Dsig.source=/appserver/lib/jakartaee-api.jar:${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar  \
              -Dmap.file=/jakartaee-tck/install/jakartaee/bin/sig-test.map  \
              -Drecorder.type=sigtest  \
              record.sig.batch

if you changed any version IDs in your map file, rerecord the signatures.
cd $TS_HOME/bin
cp sig-test.map sig-test-pkg-list.txt $TS_HOME/install/<your_deliverable>/bin/
cd $TS_HOME/install/<your_deliverable>/bin/
sccs create sig-test.map sig-test-pkg-list.txt
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest
mkdir <your_deliverable>
cd <your_deliverable>
cp ../build.xml.txt ./build.xml
"cp ../SampleSigTest.java.txt ./<your_deliverable>SigTest.java" for stand alone sig tests
OR
"cp ../SampleSigTestEE.java.txt ./<your_deliverable>SigTest.java"  for container run sig tests 
Edit <your_deliverable>SigTest.java.java
 - go to the bottom of the file and choose the appropriate test comment, you have
     a choice of two, see the comments in the file to help you decide which
     test comment to use.  Make sure you have a property named "ts_home" set to
     your install directory.  This property must be made available to your runtime
     environment.  Normally this is done by placing the property and its value
     in the bin/ts.jte file or bin/build.xml.
 - implement the getPackages method in <your_deliverable>SigTest.java
 - replace the string "<your_test_dir_name>" with the name of your test directory
 - replace the string "<your_test_class_name>" with the name of your test class.
Edit build.xml:
 - replace the string "<your_test_dir_name>" with the name of your test directory
   that you created in step 3 above.
 - replace the string "<your_test_class_name>" with the name of your test class.
 - If your signature tests do not run in any Jakarta EE vehicles edit the package target
   so the target is empty.  In other wordsdDelete the current package target and
   replace it with:
      <target name="package">
      </target>
sccs create your test class, "<your_deliverable>SigTest.java", and the build.xml file


Other Changes
-------------
In your $TS_HOME/install/<your_deliverable>/bin directory:
- In build.properties make sure $TS_HOME/lib/apiCheck.jar is added to the ts.classpath property
- In ts.jte make sure apiCheck.jar is added to the classpaths for the following properties:
     env.ts_unix.command.testExecute
     env.ts_unix.command.testExecuteAppClient
     env.ts_win32.command.testExecute
     env.ts_win32.command.testExecuteAppClient
  You can remove the sigTestClasspath, sigTestUrl and sigTestSetupUrl properties
  NOTE: sigTestClasspath may be required for running sigtool verification tests.  Without
        setting this sigTestClasspath variable, the sigtool will NOT be able to detect
        if extra classes have been added to the API/jars being verified.
- In java.policy and server.policy.append (if it exists) add the following permissions:
     permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers";
     permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "createClassLoader";
     permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
- Verify that your $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/map.jtc file contains the following line:
     signaturetest/<your_test_dir_name>/*.java com.sun.ts.lib.harness.TSTestFinder
     Also, ensure that this file is controlled under the install/<your_deliverable>/other
     directory.



NOTE:  If for some reason the API under test is not part of the test environment, users
       may specify a classpath that contains the test API by setting the property
       "sigTestClasspath" in the ts.jte file.  This should only be used when the API
       under test can NOT be added to the test environment.  USers should prefer to
       add the test API to the classpath of the VM running the signature tests.
       Again - it's worth noting that setting this sigTestClasspath variable allows
       the sigtool to detect if extra classes have been added to the API under test.
       Without setting this variable, we will not be able to detect if the API under
       test has extra classes in it.  This is because the current sigtool uses 
       Reflection to detect if each entry in our sigfiles is loaded.  But there is no
       way to use Reflection to detect if some new class is loaded thus we use this
       property to specify a jar file to be parsed and searched for new classes that
       might not be listed in our current sig files.

5.  Additional Notes
----------------------

A.  Using apicheck:
-------------------
 By default, the signature test framework will use sigtest.  If a TCK
 wishes to use ApiCheck, the following steps must be taken:

 1.  In the TCK specific signature test client, the getSigTestDriver()
     method *must* be overridden to return the SignatureTestDriver 
     implementation for ApiCheck:
      
          /**
           * <p>Override default implemenation to use ApiCheck vs SigTest.</p>
           */
         protected SignatureTestDriver getSigTestDriver() {
              if (driver == null) {
                  driver = SignatureTestDriverFactory.
                      getInstance(SignatureTestDriverFactory.API_CHECK);
              }
              return driver;
          } // END getSigTestDriver


 2.  When invoking the 'record.sig.batch' target to record the API signatures,
     an additional property *must* be passed:  -Drecorder.type=apicheck
      
     tsant -find record-build.xml \
           -Dsig.source=/appserver/lib/jakartaee-api.jar:${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar  \
           -Dmap.file=$TS_HOME/bin/sig-test.map  \
           -Drecorder.type=apicheck  \
           record.sig.batch


B. Using SigTest:
-----------------
When running sigtests, make sure you have properly set the ts.jte files
sigTestClasspath variable.  If your particular TCK does not have this 
variable in the ts.jte file, add it.  This should contain the jar files
for the classes you are testing AND any classes that will be referenced.
Example/
   sigTestClasspath=${javaee.home}/lib/jakartaee-api.jar:${JAVA_HOME}/lib/rt.jar



C.  Differences between SigTest and APICheck:
---------------------------------------------
SigTest and ApiCheck are both tools used for verifying class API's but 
they are different.  ApiCheck is being phased out as of cts 5.0 and sigtest
is the tool of choice.  (As of cts 5.0, apicheck is still used for JBI so 
we still need to make sure it exists but that should be the only one still
using it.)

sigtest jar file(s):
 sigtest.jar   :  used for running/verifying sigtests
 sigtestdev.jar : used for running/verifying sigtests AND recording sigtests
                  note:  as a general rule, only we (cts) should record sigfiles
                  so this means we should NOT ship sigtestdev.jar to anyone.

apicheck file(s):
 apicheck.jar  :  used for running/verifying sigtests AND recording sigtests
                  this does NOT have any 5.0 support for annotations etc so 
                  is only valid for pre 5.0 java versions.
